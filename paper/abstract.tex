Creating indexes to aid search through structured data is a finicky business,
and it is especially hard to make these indexes achieve sub-polynomial search time.
This paper looks into problem of automatically creating an index for arbitrary user defined data types.
It details a procedure for the creation of a metric from data types.
It then shows how to use this metric to create an index that provides $O(\log(n))$ bounded search.
The modularity of this system allowed the creation of a package \textit{type2met},
which automatically creates metrics from given types.
We then use this module to create a fast search engine for Go functions based on their signature.
We demonstrate its use on a number of packages from the Go standard library,
showing that we get good search results and we get strong speed up over linear search.
