Metrics provide a sensible definition of distance:
the distance from an object to itself is none,
the distance between and object and another is same in either direction,
and the distance between an object and another is the shortest way to get there.
Because of this, they are often used for searching for the nearest objects to some query.
They've been used for image processing, computational biology, computer vision, mealody search, amongst others \cite{chen}.
