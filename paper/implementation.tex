We implemented the automatic type to metric converter,
vantage point tree,
and Go type extractor in Go\cite{github}.
We seek to answer the following two research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{RQ1}] Can we automatically create metrics from given types?
    \item[\textbf{RQ2}] Are these metrics effective in reducing time complexity of problems?
    \item[\textbf{RQ3}] Do we get adequate results from our query to axe?
\end{itemize}
