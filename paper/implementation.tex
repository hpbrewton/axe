We implemented the automatic type to metric converter,
vantage point tree,
and Go type extractor in Go lang.
We seek to answer the following two research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{RQ1}] Can we automatically create metrics from given types?
    \item[\textbf{RQ2}] Are these metrics effecitve in reducing time complexity of problems?
\end{itemize}

Is this the problem
