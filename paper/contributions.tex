Our contributions are 

\begin{itemize}
    \item[The Metric Definition Problem] 
    We describe a novel problem of automatically creating metrics for arbitrary data
    with solutions applicable to search, machine learning, and program synthesis.
    \item[Automatic Metric Creation]
    We descibe a solution to the previous problem that uses vanila type objects
    to guide in the automatic creation of a metric for product, sum, list, map, channel, and primative types,
    as well as version of super-typing.
    \item[Application]
    We apply this metric to speed up code search.
    \item[Evaluation]
    We give a discussion of our implementation and show the serious improvements that can be gained through using 
    a metric to improve complex data search.
