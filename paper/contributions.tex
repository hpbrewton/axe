Our contributions are 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Metric Definition Problem: }
    We describe a novel problem of automatically creating metrics for arbitrary data
    with solutions applicable to search, machine learning, and program synthesis.
    \item \textbf{Automatic Metric Creation: }
    We describe a solution to the previous problem that uses vanilla type objects
    to guide in the automatic creation of a metric for product, sum, list, map, channel, and primitive types.
    \item \textbf{Application: }
    We apply this metric to speed up code search.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation: }
    We give a discussion of our implementation and show the improvements that can be gained through using 
    a metric to improve complex data search.
