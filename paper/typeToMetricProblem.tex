\begin{definition}[Type To Metric Problem]
    Let $\fT$ be some type theory.
    The type to metric problem asks to take some $T \in \fT$,
    and create a metric $d_{T}$.
    $d_{T}$ should satisfy all of the metric properties between any two objects $x$ and $y$ of type $T$.
\end{definition}

In the following sections we will use this problem definition to show several solutions to the above problem for different theories.
After seeing these different theories will see how these can be combined to create a complete solution for a reasonably complex type system --
something very similar to Go.
