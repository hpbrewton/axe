We will now briefly show that the linear combination of metrics is a metric.
Suppose we have a metric $d(a, b) = \sum c_id_i(a, b)$, 
where $c_i$ is a positive real number, and $d_i$ is a metric.
Symmetry follows clearly.
Identity of indescernables follows as each term goes to zero, leaving the sum at zero.
The triangle ineqaulity follows $d(a, b) = \sum c_id_i(a, b) \le \sum c_id_i(a, c)+c_id_i(a, b) = d(a, c) + d(b, c)$.
