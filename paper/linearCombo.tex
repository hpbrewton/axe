We may want to use multiple definitions of distance between some object.
A simple example is finding the taxi cab distance between two points,
which is the sum of the distances between two points along any finite number of axes.
We may also want to weigh different distances different values.
This is reasonable if we consider the taxi cab analogy where blocks might be longer north-south 
than they are east-west.
We can apply this idea generally to any product type,
where we want to define the metric of that type as a linear combination of the metrics of each of the fields.

We will now briefly show that the linear combination of metrics is a metric.
Suppose we have a possible metric $d(a, b) = \sum c_id_i(a, b)$, 
where $c_i$ is a positive real number, and $d_i$ is a metric.
Symmetry follows clearly.
Identity of indiscernibles follows as each term goes to zero, leaving the sum at zero.
The triangle inequality follows $d(a, b) = \sum c_id_i(a, b) \le \sum c_id_i(a, c)+c_id_i(a, b) = d(a, c) + d(b, c)$.
Thus, we can safely take a linear combination of metrics and arrive still at a metric.
