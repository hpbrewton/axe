Code reuse has long been the dream of tool designers.
It allows engineers to collectively work on performance, security, robustness, and further reuse.
One part of code reuse is being able to search through a large code base and find functions that have already written.
Previous work \cite{cox} has looked as using raw source code.
Other work \cite{mitchell:hoogle_16_may_2011} has instead used an adhoc rewriting scheme to find the difference between pieces of code,
requiring linear time to search through the code.
