Code reuse has long been the dream of tool designers.
It allows engineers to collectively work on performance, security, robustness, and further reuse.
One part of code reuse is being able to search through a large code base and find functions that have already written.
Previous work \cite{cox} has looked as using raw source code.
Other work \cite{mitchell:hoogle_16_may_2011} has instead used an adhoc rewriting scheme to find the difference between pieces of code,
requiring linear time to search through the code.
Our second goal is to create a code search engine for Go.
We use the aforementioned metric generation to create a metric on type signatures,
then we can use this metric to create an efficient data structure for search.
This data structure both provides the logarithimic search complexity of \cite{cox} but with the richer type information of \cite{mitchell:hoogle_16_may_2011}.
We implement this search engine in a tool called Axe.
