In order to test our conversion technique we applied the converter to Go type signatures
and then created an index over this data.
Go type signatures create a recursive type, a fragment of which we provide here for understanding:

\begin{align*}
\fT &= \text{Primative} \\ 
&| \text{Slice } \fT \\ 
&| \text{Channel } \fT \\ 
&| \text{Map } \fT \quad \fT \\
&| \text{Tuple } (\tlist{\fT}) \\
&| \text{Function } (\tlist{\fT}) (\tlist{\fT}) 
\end{align*}

We can then simply apply our converter to this datatructure to create a metric.
We can then use this metric, and metric trees (which are discussed) below to create Axe,
a prototype go search engine.
