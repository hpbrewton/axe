Google code search was a popular code search engine that allowed individuals to search for code for reuse \cite{codeSearch}.
It was designed to be language agnostic, and as opposed to type based search would just use the plain text of code's source.
It used an inverted look up table that would search based on various trigrams that appeared in a querier's search \cite{cox}.
Using this trigram method is was able to achieve a strong index complexity;
however, it did not take advantage of structural language features such as type signatures.
