Using types for search has been an idea for a long time \cite{ReusablePolyType,TypeAsKey},
though these early methods often went through the process of doing a full unification and only returning those functions which perfectly unify with the query.
Hoogle \cite{hoogle} is a widely used search engine for Haskell functions.
For a while it used this pure unification strategy.
Sincer version 5, it has moved to ad-hoc search.
It essentially does random edits on the query, each edit with a particular cost,
and it then lists types based on the number of edits required to move from type to another type.
This was a large improvement in query quality over previous results as it allows users to enter imperfect types.
However, because it uses this adhoc approach it still requires linear time to the search.
