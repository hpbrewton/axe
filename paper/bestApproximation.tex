One natural extension of this work is create a best approximation of types in some euclidean space.
The idea would be to find a way to embed the points of the metric space in some arbitrary euclidean space chosen 
by using the metric of the metric space to try to space out instances of a type.
This presents its own problems particularly because the points of the metric spaces we have been dealing with 
deal with arbitrarily large trees of data.
However, if we ware able to approximate this embedding,
then we can convert arbitrary data structures into reasonable fixed dimension vectors.
