We presented the problem of generting metrics based on a type.
We then provided a reasonable solution to this problem,
the first know to the author.
We then implemented this solution in a tool called Type2Metric,
which takes a type defined in GoLang and creates a metric from that type.
We then made an instance of this conversion,
using Type2Metric,
that takes Go type signatures and creates a metrizable object.
We then used this this metric to create a Go Search tool called Axe,
which is the first $O(log(n))$ type based search tool known to the author.
