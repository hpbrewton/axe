The ``2vec'' genre is a common genre of paper in the machine learning community \cite{mikolov2013distributed,jaeger2018mol2vec}.
The general idea is to take some object such as string, molecule, or whole graph and convert those objects into a vector.
These vectors are then used in various machine learning tasks such as translation and classification.
This is done using domain specific knowledge about the type being converted into a vector.
Type2Metric provides a somewhat similar feature, but only converts to metrics. 
These metrics can be used for many tasks but can not yet be put into a machine learning model,
though a machine learning model could be applied to the constants used by Type2Metric.
